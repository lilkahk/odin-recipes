    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Wonderful homey chicken dish. This is a recipe from a relative in Panama. 
        Fluff the rice carefully with a fork before serving, and enjoy!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Â¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (4 to 6 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup rice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir chicken pieces 
            until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove chicken with a slotted spoon and place on a plate. 
            Cook and stir onion, green bell pepper, minced garlic, and whole garlic cloves in the same 
            Dutch oven until onion is softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return chicken to the onion mixture. Add tomatoes, rice, salt, oregano, black pepper, and bay 
            leaf. Pour in enough chicken stock to cover all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken-rice mixture in the preheated oven until rice is tender and chicken is no longer 
            pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer 
            inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stir peas, olives, raisins, and pimento peppers into the chicken-rice mixture. Bake until warmed through, 
            an additional 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
